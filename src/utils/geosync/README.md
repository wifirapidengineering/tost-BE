## Features

- **Realtime Data Synchronization:** Automatically sync location updates across multiple nodes and threads to maintain consistent spatial awareness.
- **Customizable Matching Engine:** Fine-tune search parameters, scoring metrics, and match thresholds to meet your application’s unique needs.
- **Scalable Architecture:** Optimized for high throughput in dynamic, distributed systems.
- **Seamless Integration:** Easily integrate with popular web frameworks, mobile backends, and cloud services.
- **Advanced Query Capabilities:**
  - **Bounding Box Queries:** Retrieve all location points within a given rectangular area.
  - **Radius-Based Queries:** Identify nearby points within a dynamic radius from any query coordinate.
  - **Custom Scoring & Ranking:** Leverage custom algorithms to rank matches based on business-specific metrics.

## Usage

### Initializing the Service

Create a new instance of Geosynchronous for your geolocation dataset:

```js
// Initialize Geosynchronous for a real-time matching service
const geoService = new Geosynchronous({
  capacity: 5000, // Maximum number of geolocation points
  refreshInterval: 1000, // Interval in milliseconds for syncing updates
  matchingAlgorithm: "custom", // Specify a custom matching algorithm if needed
});
```

### Adding and Updating Locations

Add geolocation points with their associated metadata. You can update these points in real time as your dataset evolves:

```js
// Add a new location with metadata
const locationId = geoService.addLocation({
  latitude: 40.7128,
  longitude: -74.006,
  metadata: {
    name: "Downtown Hub",
    category: "retail",
    rating: 4.5,
  },
});

// Update location data as new information comes in
geoService.updateLocation(locationId, {
  latitude: 40.713,
  longitude: -74.007,
  metadata: { rating: 4.7 },
});
```

### Performing Queries

#### Bounding Box Query

Retrieve all geolocation points within a specified rectangular area:

```js
// Define bounding box coordinates
const resultsInArea = geoService.queryRange({
  minLatitude: 40.7,
  minLongitude: -74.02,
  maxLatitude: 40.73,
  maxLongitude: -73.98,
});

// Process the matching results
resultsInArea.forEach((result) => {
  console.log(result.metadata.name, result.metadata.category);
});
```

#### Radius-Based Query

Find all matching locations within a given radius from a specified point:

```js
// Define a center point and a search radius (in kilometers)
const nearbyLocations = geoService.queryWithin({
  latitude: 40.7128,
  longitude: -74.006,
  radius: 5,
});

// Optionally apply custom ranking to the nearby locations
const rankedResults = geoService.rankMatches(nearbyLocations, (location) => {
  // Custom scoring logic (e.g., proximity, user preferences, or other metrics)
  return computeScore(location);
});

console.log(rankedResults);
```

## API Reference

### Constructor

#### `new Geosynchronous(options)`

Creates a new instance of the Geosynchronous service.

- **options.capacity**: _Number_ — Maximum number of geolocation points to index.
- **options.refreshInterval**: _Number_ — Frequency in milliseconds to check for and apply realtime updates.
- **options.matchingAlgorithm**: _String|Function_ — Predefined or custom matching algorithm to be applied during queries.

### Methods

#### `geoService.addLocation(location)`

Adds a new geolocation point to the service.

- **location**: _Object_ — Contains `latitude`, `longitude`, and `metadata` properties.
- **Returns**: A unique identifier for the location.

#### `geoService.updateLocation(locationId, newData)`

Updates an existing geolocation point.

- **locationId**: _Number|String_ — Identifier of the location.
- **newData**: _Object_ — New data to merge into the existing location object.

#### `geoService.removeLocation(locationId)`

Removes a geolocation point from the service.

- **locationId**: _Number|String_ — Identifier of the location to be removed.

#### `geoService.queryRange({minLatitude, minLongitude, maxLatitude, maxLongitude})`

Performs a bounding box query to retrieve all locations within the specified rectangle.

- **Returns**: An array of matching location objects.

#### `geoService.queryWithin({latitude, longitude, radius})`

Retrieves locations within a given radius from a specific point.

- **Returns**: An array of location objects.

#### `geoService.rankMatches(locations, scoringFunction)`

Applies a custom scoring function to an array of location objects and returns them in ranked order.

- **scoringFunction**: _Function_ — A function that takes a location object and returns a score.

#### `geoService.exportIndex()`

Exports the current state of the geolocation index for persistence or sharing across threads.

- **Returns**: A serialized data buffer.

#### `Geosynchronous.import(data)`

Reconstructs a Geosynchronous instance from a raw data buffer.

- **data**: _ArrayBuffer_ — Serialized geolocation index data.

## Advanced Configuration

Geosynchronous is highly configurable to fit your application's performance and accuracy needs. You can adjust the following settings:

- **Indexing Granularity:** Customize the spatial resolution of your geolocation points.
- **Refresh Strategies:** Define how frequently the index should refresh to capture real-time updates.
- **Custom Matching Hooks:** Integrate custom business logic into the matching process with pre- and post-query hooks.
- **Data Partitioning:** Optimize performance for large datasets by partitioning data across multiple processing units.

## Examples & Use Cases

### Ride-Sharing Service

In a ride-sharing scenario, Geosynchronous can instantly match drivers to riders based on real-time geolocation updates and custom scoring criteria such as driver ratings, proximity, and route optimization.

```js
// Matching riders to nearby drivers in real time
const availableDrivers = geoService.queryWithin({
  latitude: rider.latitude,
  longitude: rider.longitude,
  radius: 3, // kilometers
});

// Rank drivers based on custom criteria (e.g., proximity, rating)
const bestDriver = geoService.rankMatches(availableDrivers, (driver) => {
  return driver.metadata.rating - driver.distanceFactor;
})[0];

dispatchDriver(bestDriver);
```

### Location-Based Marketing

For retail applications, dynamically match customers to nearby promotional offers, store events, or loyalty programs.

```js
// Query for stores within a shopping district
const localStores = geoService.queryRange({
  minLatitude: 34.05,
  minLongitude: -118.25,
  maxLatitude: 34.07,
  maxLongitude: -118.23,
});

// Customize ranking based on user preferences and past interactions
const personalizedOffers = geoService.rankMatches(
  localStores,
  userPreferenceScore
);
```
